**Payroll System for London Packaging Company Limited**

📋 **Project Overview**

This project is a Payroll Management System built using Python with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) powered by tkinter. The system is designed to automate wage calculation and management for employees (full-time, part-time, and interns) while providing a user-friendly interface for adding, updating, removing, and viewing employee details. Additionally, it uses SQLite for storing employee data.

The system leverages object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, ensuring modular and maintainable code.
